# **Dota2 Counter Picker**
The Dota 2 Counter Picker App scrapes and displays data from dotabuff in an simple and intuitive way so that the user can visualise which heroes are best against the enemy heroes selected.

The app is deployed at https://dota2-counter-picker.onrender.com/. Please note that it may take some time to load (approximately 2 to 5 minutes) since it is hosted on a free instance that puts the app to sleep if it is unused for 15 minutes.
